# Fluent-Forms-Image-Folders
Creates folders in _/uploads/fluentform_, accessible by FTP,  named _your_form_name_ and renames files _&lt;form id>-firstname_lastname-&lt;index>-&lt;extension>_

## What it does
1. It will create a sub folder in  _/uploads/fluentform_, accessible by FTP,  named _your_form_name_
2. On image upload, it will copy your images into this folder and rename them _&lt;form id>-firstname_lastname-&lt;index>-&lt;extension>_ for example: 23-alan_jackson-1.png

   ## Notes
   + This is for the Pro version of Fluent Forms
   + Deleting the files from this folder from the admin only works with the bulk delete function
   + The original files are still in the parent uploads/fluentform folder as well
